This is a project of programming the usb midi controller using a raspberry pi pico, 16 arcade buttons, and a joystick, and a slide potentiometer  

The project code mainly using the code from here
<https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-pico-led-arcade-button-midi-controller-fighter/coding-the-raspberry-pi-pico-midi-controller>

also im referencing other codes from other places because I'm using different components such as a analog joystick, slide potentiometer etc.

A compliant README must satisfy all the requirements listed below.

> Note: Standard Readme is designed for open source libraries. Although it's [historically](README.md#background) made for Node and npm projects, it also applies to libraries in other languages and package managers.

**Requirements:**
  - Be called README.md (with capitalization).
  - If the project supports i18n, the file must be named accordingly: `README.de.md`, where `de` is the BCP 47 Language tag. For naming, prioritize non-regional subtags for languages. If there is only one README and the language is not English, then a different language in the text is permissible without needing to specify the BCP tag: e.g., `README.md` can be in German if there is no `README.md` in another language. Where there are multiple languages, `README.md` is reserved for English.
  - Be a valid Markdown file.
  - Sections must appear in order given below. Optional sections may be omitted.
  - Sections must have the titles listed below, unless otherwise specified. If the README is in another language, the titles must be translated into that language.
  - Must not contain broken links.
  - If there are code examples, they should be linted in the same way as the code is linted in the rest of the project.
